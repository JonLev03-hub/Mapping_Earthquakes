# Mapping_Earthquakes
In this repository I have used javascript and HTML to connect to earthquake data apis, and displayed this data in leaflet.

This is a screenshot of the website. I could not post it to github pages because github pages only hosts static sites so the leaflet maps dont show correctly. 
If downloading this repository you will be able to open index.html and view the basic map shown above. 

In the top right corner you are able to open a settings menu (displayed below)

This allows you to do basic customizations of the map using leaflets map settings, and display differnt selections of earthquake data. You can toggle between displaying all earthquakes or just the major earthquakes, and you can also remove the tectonic plates displayed in the map. 

This site was built simply to educate me on the topic of leaflet and to start my learning in html and javascript so it is pretty basic but I have learned tons from this project when it comes to the basics of these packages.
